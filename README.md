The Promo Fixer
===============

The perfect accessory for the DJ who is a mailing list which only seems to send up WAVs without any metadata.

Promo Fixer converts them to WAVs and then adds Artist and Title tags based on some heuristic deduction from the
filenames.

Please beat in mind that this is pretty much tailored only to my personal experience. Your mileage will probably vary.

Usage
-----

    ./promo-fixer.sh --dir <somewhere>
